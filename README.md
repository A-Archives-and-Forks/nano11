# **nano11 üî¨**

A PowerShell script to build an even more heavily trimmed-down Windows 11 image.

## **Introduction**

Introducing nano11 builder, a PowerShell script that creates an even smaller Windows 11 image!

The goal of nano11 is to automate the build of a streamlined Windows 11 image. The script uses only built-in DISM capabilities and the official oscdimg.exe (downloaded automatically) to create a bootable ISO with no external binaries. An included unattended answer file helps bypass the Microsoft Account requirement during setup and enables compact installation by default.
It's open-source, so feel free to modify and adapt it to your needs\! Also, feedback is much appreciated!

## **‚ò¢Ô∏è BEFORE YOU BEGIN:**

This is an **extreme experimental script** designed for creating a quick and dirty development testbed. It removes everything possible to get the smallest footprint, including the Windows Component Store (WinSxS), core services, and much more.

The resulting OS is **not serviceable**. This means you cannot add languages, drivers, or features, and you will not receive Windows Updates. It is intended only for testing, development, or embedded use in VMs where a minimal, static environment is required.

## **What is removed?**

The nano11.ps1 script is extremely aggressive. It removes:

* **All Bloatware Apps:** Clipchamp, News, Weather, Xbox, Office Hub, Solitaire, etc.  
* **Core System Components:**  
  * ‚õî **Windows Component Store (WinSxS)**  
  * ‚õî **Windows Update** (and its services)  
  * ‚õî **Windows Defender** (and its services)  
  * ‚õî Most **Drivers** (keeps VGA, Net, Storage only)  
  * ‚õî **All IMEs** (Asian languages)  
  * ‚õî Search, BitLocker, Biometrics, and Accessibility features  
  * ‚õî Most system services (including Audio)  
* **Other Components:**  
  * Microsoft Edge & OneDrive  
  * Internet Explorer & Tablet PC Math

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** You cannot add back features or languages in an image created with this script\!

## **Instructions**

1. **Download Windows 11** from the Microsoft website.  
2. **Mount the downloaded ISO** image by right-clicking it and selecting "Mount". Note the drive letter.  
3. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**.  
4. **Set the execution policy** for the current session by running this command:  
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass \-Scope Process

5. **Navigate to the script's folder** and start it:  
   C:\\path\\to\\your\\nano11\\nano11.ps1

6. **Follow the prompts:** The script will ask for the drive letter of the mounted image and the edition (SKU) you want to base your image on.  
7. **Sit back and relax\!** When completed, the new ISO will be in the same folder as the script.

In the end you should get an image that is up to **3 times** as smaller as a standard Windows 11 image!
